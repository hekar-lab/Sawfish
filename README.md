# Sawfish

Builds the necessary SLEIGH files (`.slaspec`, `.pspec`, `.cspec`)
for the [Ghidra-BlackfinPlus](https://github.com/hekar-lab/Ghidra-BlackFinPlus) plugin.

## RIP

This is alright but after much deliberation it was concluded that the slaspec part would benefit from being a bit more
flexible. So we're making a transpiler: [SLAx](https://github.com/hekar-lab/SLAx). In effect that pretty much renders this
project useless. We'll leave it up to fool the world into believing that we're more productive than we actually are though :)

TL;DR we've got bigger fish to fry.
